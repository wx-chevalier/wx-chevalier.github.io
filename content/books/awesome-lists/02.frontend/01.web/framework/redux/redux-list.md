# Overview

- [2015-A Cartoon Intro to Redux](https://code-cartoons.com/a-cartoon-intro-to-redux-3afb775501a6#.2ejvlos6s): One thing that causes even more confusion than Flux is the difference between Flux and Redux, a pattern that was inspired by Flux. In this article I‚Äôll explain the differences between the two.

# Overview

## Designing

- [2018-Redesigning Redux](https://hackernoon.com/redesigning-redux-b2baee8b8a38): Shouldn‚Äôt state management be a solved problem by now? Intuitively, developers seem to know a hidden truth: state management seems harder than it needs to be.

## Case Study | Ê°à‰æãÂàÜÊûê

# Resource

## Book

- [2016-Developing a Redux Edge üìö](https://parg.co/b4L): This book is for anyone wanting to learn about Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It is aimed at intermediate developers who have a good understanding of creating single page applications with JavaScript. Having an understanding of ES6, functional programming, and React will certainly help too, but isn‚Äôt necessary. If you want to follow along with the examples you should also know your way around a terminal, and know what Node and npm are, as well as having them installed and ready to use.

# Tutorial

It‚Äôs a best practice that has improved the management of my applications.

- [2017-How Redux Works: A Counter-Example](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/): So in this post we‚Äôre going to demystify how Redux works with a backwards approach that I think will help your understanding.

- [2017-Learn Redux by coding a Mini-Redux](http://blog.jakoblind.no/2017/03/13/learn-redux-by-coding-a-mini-redux/): A different learning strategy is to code a simple Redux yourself to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of the library.
