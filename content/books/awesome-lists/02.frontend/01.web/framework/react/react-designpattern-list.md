# React Pattern List

- [2016-来自 AlloyTeam 的 React.js 2016 最佳实践](http://www.alloyteam.com/2016/01/reactjs-best-practices-for-2016/)

# Architecture Pattern | 架构模式

- [2016-React Patterns](http://reactpatterns.com/): Patterns for React Developers

- [2017-10 React mini-patterns](https://hackernoon.com/10-react-mini-patterns-c1da92f068c5#.5v2hpgurn): Over the last few years, I’ve worked on a handful of decent-sized React projects, and many, many pint-sized ones. Throughout this magical journey, a number of patterns have come up that I find myself repeating again and again.

- [2018-Evolving Patterns in React](https://parg.co/UXm): Let’s take a closer look at some of the patterns that are emerging in the React ecosystem. These patterns improve readability, code clarity, and push your code towards composition and reusability.

## Functional React | 函数式 React

- [2017-Functional setState is the future of React](https://parg.co/bMW): Declare state changes separately from the component classes.

- [non-functional-react-js](https://medium.com/@arqex/non-functional-react-js-6e020ce27ee2#.cj3dcxl4j)

- [Functional React Series — Part 1: Get your App outta my Component](https://medium.com/@adamterlson/functional-react-series-part-1-get-your-app-outta-my-component-92656ae13e25#.q47pt8fga)

- [Rendering a function with React](https://parg.co/UEv): How I tricked React into rendering a function (not call it… render it)

- [2017-Container Components](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005#.h775w7ifn): One React pattern that’s had the impact on my code is the container component pattern.

- [Presentational and Container Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.uz8irdipq)

## HOCs | 高阶组件

- [Higher Order React Components](http://natpryce.com/articles/000814.html)

- [Higher-Order Components in React](http://6me.us/MUHBdp)

- [2017-Why you should keep your react components pure by using HOCs](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-should-keep-your-react-components-pure-by-using-hocs-67e5c7f80c81): In this article I show how decomposing state from the presentational layer can both reduce complexity and promote code re-use with some React examples— a win-win situation helping to tame the challenges of developing SPAs. Although I’m using React, the lessons are universal and can apply to any framework.

- [2017-Understanding Higher Order Components](https://parg.co/biZ): Making sense of the rapidly changing React best practice.

- [React Higher Order Components in depth](https://medium.com/@franleplant/react-higher-order-components-in-depth-cf9032ee6c3e#.52i6nt3at)

- [Share Code between React and React Apps using Higher Order Components](https://hackernoon.com/code-reuse-using-higher-order-hoc-and-stateless-functional-components-in-react-and-react-native-6eeb503c665#.4z4q9o6k2)

- [Renderless Components or How Logic Doesn't Always Need a UI](http://kyleshevlin.com/renderless-components/)

- [2018-hocs ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/deepsweet/hocs): A collection of Higher-Order Components for React and React Native.

### Recompose

- [2016-Building HOCs with Recompose](https://medium.com/front-end-developers/building-hocs-with-recompose-7debb951d101)

- [2016-Why The Hipsters Recompose Everything](https://medium.com/javascript-inside/why-the-hipsters-recompose-everything-23ac08748198): Building a Utility Library for React

- [2017-Higher Order Components with Functional Patterns Using Recompose](https://egghead.io/courses/higher-order-components-with-functional-patterns-using-recompose): In this course, you will learn to use many of the most powerful and convenient higher-order components within Recompose by coding several real-world examples. Using recompose looks very different from “vanilla” React; so you will also get comfortable with the look and feel of a “recomposed” component. The best part is no more need for class components! You’ll learn how to use Recompose to both modify components and also create your own higher-order components.

- [2017-Top 5 Recompose HOCs](https://parg.co/bJV): Today we’ll be going through my 5 (in no particular order) favorite Recompose Higher Order Components.

- [2019-Writing Resilient Components](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/): There are important design principles that every component should strive to follow. But I don’t think style guides capture those principles well. We’ll talk about style guides first, and then look at the principles that really are useful.

## Code Organization | 代码组织
