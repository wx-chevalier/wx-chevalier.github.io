- [2017-I made React Native fast, you can too](http://6me.us/3Yx9): The purpose of this article is to walk you through how you can use Native tools to track down and fix performance issues in your React Native app.

- [携程是如何做 React Native 优化的](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/23715716)

- [2016-React Native 痛点解析之性能调优](http://www.infoq.com/cn/articles/react-native-performance-tuning)：自从 React Native 出世，虽然官方一直尽可能的优化其性能，为了能让其媲美原生 App 的速度，但是现实感觉有点不尽人意。接下来介绍下实践中遇到的一些性能问题以及优化方案。以下对性能参数的依据是来自于 React Native 自带的 FPS Monitor.。

- [Moving Beyond Animations to User Interactions at 60 FPS in React Native](https://hackernoon.com/moving-beyond-animations-to-user-interactions-at-60-fps-in-react-native-b6b1fa0ba525#.s9qc4wo93): The async nature of the React Native bridge incurs an inherent performance penalty, preventing JavaScript code from running at high framerates. Modern animation libraries, like Animated, address this by minimizing passes over the bridge. User interactions, where UI continuously reacts to the user’s gestures, are a step further. How can we run those at 60 FPS?
