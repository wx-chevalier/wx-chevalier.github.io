# DataScienceAI Toolkit List

- [[原]深入对比数据科学工具箱：Python 和 R 之争](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/20885818)

- [Evaluation of Deep Learning Toolkits](https://github.com/zer0n/deepframeworks)

- [2015-Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/): At the moment, deep learning is held together by an extremely successful tool. This tool doesn’t seem fundamental; it’s something we’ve stumbled on, with seemingly arbitrary details that change regularly. As a field, we don’t yet have some unifying insight or shared understanding. In fact, the field has several competing narratives!

# GPU

- [2018-Basic Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) design concepts](https://iq.opengenus.org/basic-graphics-processing-unit-gpu-design-concepts/): A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a processor like CPU and TPU for faster graphics processing.

# CUDA
