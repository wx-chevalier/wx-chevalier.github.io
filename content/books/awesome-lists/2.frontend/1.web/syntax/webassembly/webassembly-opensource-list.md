# WebAssembly OpenSource List

# Showcase

- [2017-ROCKET - A RUST GAME RUNNING ON WASM](https://parg.co/UZJ): I thought it would be interesting to try to adapt my game Rocket to work on the browser through the wasm32-unknown-unknown target.

- [AssemblyScript ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/prototype): AssemblyScript defines a subset of TypeScript that it compiles to WebAssembly.

- [Walt ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/ballercat/walt): WAlt is an alternative syntax for WebAssembly text format. It's an experiment for using JavaScript syntax to write to as 'close to the metal' as possible.

- [WebAssemblyStudio ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/wasdk/WebAssemblyStudio): Learn, Teach, Work and Play in the Web Assembly Studio.

- [v86 ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/copy/v86): v86 emulates an x86-compatible CPU and hardware. Machine code is translated to WebAssembly modules at runtime in order to achieve decent performance.

- [Zaplib ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/Zaplib): âš¡ Zaplib is an open-source library for speeding up web applications using Rust and WebAssembly.

## Server

- [WebAssembly Micro Runtime ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/intel/wasm-micro-runtime): WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) is standalone WebAssembly (WASM) runtime with a small footprint. It includes a few components.

- [2022-microservice-rust-mysql ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/second-state/microservice-rust-mysql): A template project for building a database-driven microservice in Rust and run it in the WasmEdge sandbox.

# Compiler

- [CoWasm ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cowasm): CoWasm: Collaborative WebAssembly for Servers and Browsers. Built using Zig. Supports Python with extension modules, including numpy.

- [2022-Cheerp ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/leaningtech/cheerp-meta)](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerp-meta): a C/C++ compiler for Web applications - compiles to WebAssembly and JavaScript.

# Interpreter & Runtime

- [wasm3 ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3): ðŸš€ The fastest WebAssembly interpreter.

- [wasmer ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer): ðŸš€ The leading WebAssembly Runtime supporting WASI and Emscripten

- [wazero ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero): the zero dependency WebAssembly runtime for Go developers

- [wasmtime ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime): A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly

- [WasmEdge ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge): WasmEdge is a lightweight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud native, edge, and decentralized applications. It powers serverless apps, embedded functions, microservices, smart contracts, and IoT devices.

- [Extism ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/extism/extism): The universal plug-in system. Run WebAssembly extensions inside your app. Use idiomatic Host SDKs for Go, Ruby, Python, Node, Rust, C, C++, OCaml, Haskell, PHP, Elixir/Erlang & more (others coming soon).
