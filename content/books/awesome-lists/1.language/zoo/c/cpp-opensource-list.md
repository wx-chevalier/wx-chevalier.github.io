# Dev

## Test

- [2018-Google Test ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/google/googletest): This repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

- [2020-Catch2 ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2): A modern, C++-native, header-only, test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD - using C++11, C++14, C++17 and later (or C++03 on the Catch1.x branch)

## Debug

- [palanteer ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/dfeneyrou/palanteer): High performance visual profiler, debugger, tests enabler for C++ and Python.

- [libtree ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/haampie/libtree): ldd as a tree with an option to bundle dependencies into a single folder

# Library

- [Cello ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](http://libcello.org/): Cello is a library that brings higher level programming to C. By acting as a modern, powerful runtime system Cello makes many things easy that were previously impractical or awkward in C.

- [gc ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/mkirchner/gc): Simple, zero-dependency garbage collection for C.

## Common Library

- [2004-Boost ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://www.boost.org/): Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

- [2017-Abseil ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/abseil/abseil-cpp)](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp#quickstart): The repository contains the Abseil C++ library code. Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ code (compliant to C++14) designed to augment the C++ standard library.

- [2017-Folly ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/facebook/folly)](https://github.com/facebook/folly): Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of C++14 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind. Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.

## Concurrent

- [ck ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/concurrencykit/ck): Concurrency primitives, safe memory reclamation mechanisms and non-blocking (including lock-free) data structures designed to aid in the research, design and implementation of high performance concurrent systems developed in C99+.
