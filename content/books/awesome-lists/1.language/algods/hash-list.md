# Hash List

# Bloom Filter

- [2017-Let’s Implement a Bloom Filter in Go](https://codeburst.io/lets-implement-a-bloom-filter-in-go-b2da8a4b849f): I remember some time ago while I was reading some articles about Cassandra internals that it used bloom filters to check if the particular SSTables are likely to have the request partition data.

# SuRF

# Algorithms

- [Hashids](https://hashids.org/): Hashids is a small open-source library that generates short, unique, non-sequential ids from numbers.

- [I Wrote The Fastest Hashtable](http://6me.us/sGhX): Now I finally wrote the fastest hashtable. And by that I mean that I have the fastest lookups of any hashtable I could find, while my inserts and erases are also really fast. (but not the fastest)

# HashTable

- [2017-Hashing Out Hash Functions](https://dev.to/vaidehijoshi/hashing-out-hash-functions): let’s find out more about hash functions, how they work, and their strengths and weakness. Hopefully, this will help us understand when exactly they can help us out!
