# JavaScript Engine & V8 List

# Overview

- [2017-认识 V8 引擎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27628685)：V8 是如何使得 JavaScript 性能有大幅提升的呢？通过对一些书籍和文章的学习，梳理了 V8 的相关内容，本文将带你认识 V8。

- [2017-Understanding JS Engine with Cartoons](https://parg.co/U3B)

- [2017-Node.js V8 internals: an illustrative primer](https://parg.co/UXh): It’s really interesting to dig some proof of concept technology, it also will help us to write better code.

## News

- [High-performance ES2015 and beyond](http://6me.us/2dRAT4): Over the last couple of months the V8 team focused on bringing the performance of newly added ES2015 and other even more recent JavaScript features on par with their transpiled ES5 counterparts.

## Resource

# Complier

- [2017-How The Performance Characteristics of V8's Turbofan Will Affect The Way WE Optimize ](https://www.nearform.com/blog/node-js-is-getting-a-new-v8-with-turbofan/):

- [2017-Understanding How the Chrome V8 Engine Translates JavaScript into Machine Code](https://parg.co/Utm): All of our systems consists of microprocessors, the thing that is sitting inside your computer right now and allowing you to read this.

- [2017-Understanding V8’s Bytecode](https://parg.co/bzQ): This article explains V8’s bytecode format — which is actually easy to read once you understand some basic concepts.

# AST

- JavaScript Generator: [ECMAScript code generator on steroids](https://github.com/inikulin/esotope), [ECMAScript code generator](https://github.com/estools/escodegen)

- [前端工程师为什么要学习编译原理？](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/31096468): 而编译原理，作为一门基础理论学科，除了 JS 语言本身的编译器之外，更成为 Babel、ESLint、Stylus、Flow、Pug、YAML、Vue、React、Marked 等开源前端框架的理论基石之一。了解编译原理能够对所接触的框架有更充分的认识。

## Optimization

- [2017-An Introduction to Speculative Optimization in V8](https://parg.co/Uuv): An impressively low-level article that we hope gives you a good idea about what happens in V8 when it comes to optimization.

## Babel

# Memory Management

- [2017-Fast Properties in V8](https://parg.co/b70): In this blog post we would like to explain how V8 handles JavaScript properties internally.

# Garbage Collection

- [2017-Orinoco: young generation garbage collection](https://parg.co/UpK): V8 partitions its managed heap into generations where objects are initially allocated in the “nursery” of the young generation.

- [2017-Garbage collection in V8, an illustrated guide](https://parg.co/bQG): I would also like to mention that this guide is meant to be beginner friendly, and does not cover every aspect of memory management within V8, and the rest of V8 internals.

- [A crash course in memory management](https://parg.co/b9p): To understand why ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer were added to JavaScript, you need to understand a bit about memory management.
