# WhatsApp List

# OpenSource

- [2022-Baileys ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/adiwajshing/Baileys)](https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys): Baileys does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket. Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like half a gig of ram :/
