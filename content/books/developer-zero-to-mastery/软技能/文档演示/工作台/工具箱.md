# 搭建高效率的开发工作台：工具与资源分享

Vetur - Includes support for .vue files, including but not limited to: Syntax-highlighting, Emmet, Linting / Error Checking, Formatting, Auto Completion, Debugging
Vue Snippets - These are my own snippets to supercharge Vue application development 🚀
Prettier - Never worry about formatting your code ever again, keep everything consistent with ease. My suggestion is to add "editor.tabCompletion": true, "editor.formatOnSave": true, to your settings file in preferences.
Bookmarks - Adds a bookmark to places you designate in your file, and allows you to quickly jump between them. Super helpful. 🔖
Jumpy - We lose a lot of time scanning with a mouse, time we can get back by using our keyboard instead. Jumpy provides fast cursor movement by giving you a couple of keys that offer a hook to get to another part of the document.
NPM Intellisense - a plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements
ES6 Snippets - quickly spin up ES6 JavaScript with only 3 or 4 characters
Copy Relative Path - copies the relative path of any file right from the sidebar by right-clicking.
