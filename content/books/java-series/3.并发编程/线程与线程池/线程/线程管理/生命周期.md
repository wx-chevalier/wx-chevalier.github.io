# Java 线程的生命周期

# 线程状态

线程的状态：NEW，RUNNABLE，BLOCKED，WAITING，TIMED_WAITING，TERMINATED。注释也解释得很清楚各个状态的作用，而各个状态的转换也有一定的规则需要遵循的。

![](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/09/02/nCyjPA.png)

```java
public enum State {
  /**
   * Thread state for a thread which has not yet started.
   */
  NEW,
  /**
   * Thread state for a runnable thread.  A thread in the runnable
   * state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may
   * be waiting for other resources from the operating system
   * such as processor.
   */
  RUNNABLE,
  /**
   * Thread state for a thread blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
   * A thread in the blocked state is waiting for a monitor lock
   * to enter a synchronized block/method or
   * reenter a synchronized block/method after calling
   * {@link Object#wait() Object.wait}.
   */
  BLOCKED,
  /**
   * Thread state for a waiting thread.
   * A thread is in the waiting state due to calling one of the
   * following methods:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@link Object#wait() Object.wait} with no timeout</li>
   *   <li>{@link #join() Thread.join} with no timeout</li>
   *   <li>{@link LockSupport#park() LockSupport.park}</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>A thread in the waiting state is waiting for another thread to
   * perform a particular action.
   *
   * For example, a thread that has called <tt>Object.wait()</tt>
   * on an object is waiting for another thread to call
   * <tt>Object.notify()</tt> or <tt>Object.notifyAll()</tt> on
   * that object. A thread that has called <tt>Thread.join()</tt>
   * is waiting for a specified thread to terminate.
   */
  WAITING,
  /**
   * Thread state for a waiting thread with a specified waiting time.
   * A thread is in the timed waiting state due to calling one of
   * the following methods with a specified positive waiting time:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@link #sleep Thread.sleep}</li>
   *   <li>{@link Object#wait(long) Object.wait} with timeout</li>
   *   <li>{@link #join(long) Thread.join} with timeout</li>
   *   <li>{@link LockSupport#parkNanos LockSupport.parkNanos}</li>
   *   <li>{@link LockSupport#parkUntil LockSupport.parkUntil}</li>
   * </ul>
   */
  TIMED_WAITING,
  /**
   * Thread state for a terminated thread.
   * The thread has completed execution.
   */
  TERMINATED
}
```

# 线程优先级

线程优先级其实只是对线程打的一个标志，但并不意味这高优先级的一定比低优先级的先执行，具体还要看操作系统的资源调度情况。通常线程优先级为 5，边界为[1,10]。

```java
 /**
  * The minimum priority that a thread can have.
  */
 public final static int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;

/**
  * The default priority that is assigned to a thread.
  */
 public final static int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;

 /**
  * The maximum priority that a thread can have.
  */
 public final static int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;
```
