/**
 * The remaining two data structures we are going to cover are both in the
 * "tree" family.
 *
 * Much like real life, there are many different types of tree data structures.
 *

 *
 * Little did you know you'd be studying dendrology today... and thats not even
 * all of them. But don't let any of this scare you, most of those don't matter
 * at all. There were just a lot of Computer Science PhDs who had something to
 * prove.
 *
 * Trees are much like graphs or linked lists except they are "unidirectional".
 * All this means is that they can't have loops of references.
 *
 *        Tree:                Not a Tree:
 *
 *          A                        A
 *        ↙   ↘                    ↗   ↘
 *      B       C                B ←–––– C
 *
 * If you can draw a loop between connected nodes in a tree... well, you don't
 * have a tree.
 *
 * Trees have many different uses, they can used to optimize searching or
 * sorting. They can organize programs better. They can give you a
 * representation that is easier to work with.
